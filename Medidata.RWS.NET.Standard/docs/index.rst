Medidata.RWS.NET Documentation
============================================

Medidata.RWS.NET is a comprehensive, fluent .NET API library for `Medidata RAVE Web Services (RWS) <https://learn.mdsol.com/api/rws/getting-started-with-rave-web-services-95587258.html>`_. It handles a large portion of the boilerplate C# code you'd normally have to write in order to communicate with RWS, allowing you to get up and running faster.
