Introduction
============================================


Assumptions
============

This documentation assumes that the reader has a familiarity with the `Medidata RAVE platform <https://www.mdsol.com/en/products/rave>`_, as well as a basic understanding of `RESTful Web Service <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_ concepts. While the Medidata.RWS.NET library attempts to abstract away some of the typical HTTP communication mechanisms required when making typical web service requests, the underlying HTTP codes and raw request / response data is still available to developers.


Acknowledgments
===============

The creation of this library wouldn't have been possible without inspiration and examples from some fine folks at Medidata Solutions, specifically Ian Sparks and Geoff Low. In many ways, the library has taken some inspiration from the Python flavored "rwslib", available on Github: `<https://github.com/mdsol/rwslib>`_.
